An ore unification mod for Minecraft.

Ever played modded Minecraft and noticed that there are several mods which provide copper, tin, and other metals which are all incompatible with each other? Well UniDict aims to solve this problem in a much easier and faster way then modifying multiple JEI pages of recipes!

UniDict does NOT unify ore generation!
